# azure-bicep-learning
## Summary
An exercise in learning in public. Bicep artifacts and samples as I work on learning and exploring this Infrastructure as Code technology. Will also be a fair amount of learning Git and Github to get these examples published.

## Learning Resources
### Primary Resources
Thus far I've used the below as my primary resources for learning Bicep. They are listed roughly in order of use. However, I started each before finishing the previous item.
- LinkedIn Learning course ["Azure Bicep First Look"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/azure-bicep-first-look) by Elkhan Yusubov
- [Freek Berson](https://github.com/fberson)'s [Getting started with Bicep: Infrastructure as code on Azure](http://microsoftplatform.blogspot.com/2021/07/new-book-getting-started-with-bicep-now.html) book.
- [Fundamentals of Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/fundamentals-bicep/) Learning Path on Microsoft Learn.
### Other Helpful Resources
- [Azure Resource Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/) - Documentation on available resource types and resource properties with examples in Bicep, ARM template, and Terraform.
- [Use Azure Key Vault to pass secure parameter value during Bicep deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/key-vault-parameter?source=recommendations&tabs=azure-cli) within the Bicep documentation.
